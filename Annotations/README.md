## Annotation Schema



## Storage of evidence for cell set annotations



Schema:

snRNA-seq (covered by current CAS)
Literature:
Reference (free)
Cell type name (controlled)
synonyms (free?)
Associated evidence type (controlled)
Spatial
Morphology
Electrophysiology
Marker genes
How was the link made between t-type and literature source (free)
Spatial
MERSCOPE ROI (controlled)
CCF ROI (controlled) ← why is this separate (post registration?)
Dissected ROI (controlled)
Expert description (free)
Patchseq
Expert description (free)

Outcomes:

Form for controlled/semi-controlled info (as above)
Template for evidence summary
Literature type summary  

Example stitching of modality evidence into card:

STR FS PTHLH ST18 GABA corresponds to PVALB+, PTHLH+ (ref), { synonym } (ref).   

Supporting evidence:
Location:  …  This is supported by its location in the striatum (references) and merfish data, its morphology {some description} (reference) 
and patch-seq data and that it is fast spiking (references) - summary of e-phys data supporting fast spiking.
