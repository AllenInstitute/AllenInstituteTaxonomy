# AllenInstituteTaxonomy

To distribute Allen Institute Taxonomies (AIT) we define an [`anndata`](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) .h5ad file which encapsulates the essential components of a taxonomy required for downstream analysis such as [cell type mapping](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/scrattch-mapping/tree/main).
